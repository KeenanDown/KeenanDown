I'm Keenan Down, a recent MMath graduate from the University of Warwick in the UK.
My background is mathematical but I'm also currently studying some data science - I'm especially interested in the use of computational tools to ask mathematical questions.
You can reach me at my email keenandown@hotmail.co.uk
