I'm Keenan Down, a recent MMath graduate from the University of Warwick in the UK.
My background is mathematical but I'm now branching out into data science - I'm interested in the use of computational tools to ask mathematical questions and the use of data science in delivering health and educational outcomes.
You can reach me at my email keenandown@hotmail.co.uk
